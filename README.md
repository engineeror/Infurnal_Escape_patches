_for AGB-AIFE-USA_

## Save the password to SRAM
No more annoying typing — getting the password shown on screen saves it to SRAM  
[save\_to\_sram.ips](save_to_sram.ips)

## Swap A & B

## Faster screen fade out
Because next screen/level begins loading only after screen fades out  
[faster\_screen\_fades.ips](faster_screen_fades.ips)

## Invincibility and no mission timeouts
Explore without grind  
[invincibility\_and\_no\_timeouts.ips](invincibility_and_no_timeouts.ips)
